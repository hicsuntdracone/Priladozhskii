# Priladozhskii
This map presents a high-resolution photogrammetric base map of the Priladozhskii area generated from UAV imagery. Aerial photographs were processed in Agisoft Metashape to produce a 3 cm/pixel orthomosaic and digital terrain model (DTM), providing detailed representation of terrain and surface features. The orthomosaic was digitized in QGIS to create a vector base map including roads, buildings, and land-cover classes. The resulting map integrates precise photogrammetric outputs with manually interpreted features to support local spatial analysis and visualization.
